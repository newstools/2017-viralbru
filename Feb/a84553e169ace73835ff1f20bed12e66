Those in the Cape will have to be careful of how much water they use in the upcoming weeks, with the new Level 3B water restrictions in place.With the severe lack of water in the Cape, a crisis is imminent.Please, if you live in the Cape, do your bit and stick to the water restrictions.Unless you&#8217;d like us all to be bathing in Camps Bay.
