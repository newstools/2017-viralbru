Firstly, we&#8217;re not fake news. We try very hard to make sure the stuff we bring you isn&#8217;t false, but like everybody we sometimes make mistakes.Some &#8220;fake news&#8221; does slip through the cracks, and we do our best to rectify it as soon as it&#8217;s verified as being fake. In this regard we thank the viewers who comment on the Facebook pages, who pick up falsehoods in the post which may have slipped our attention.We try our best to source African and South African content (A lot of which isn&#8217;t news but is funny videos or interest pieces) and one of the sources we use happens to be EWN. If there are claims that ViralBru is fake news, yet we get part of our content from EWN, couldn&#8217;t that possibly say something about what it is they post?Lastly there is a big difference between &#8220;Fake News&#8221; and opinionated reporting. We&#8217;re not a massive corporation, the regulations on what we post and how we word posts are far more relaxed than a news corporation. Opinion often slips through into our writing and that&#8217;s not something for which an apology is needed.This is an excellent example of the kak we DON&#8217;T post.We are in fact not a news site, (yes mind blown I know.) We post viral content, with the aim of trying to keep as much of it South African and to a lesser extent African content as possible. We post funny videos, news articles, interesting facts, infographics, wildlife posts, and much more. That needs to be kept in mind when you&#8217;re on here.To get back to the main point, when we post news we try our best to make sure it&#8217;s real.(Writing up a list of &#8220;Fake News&#8221; sites also sure does seem like an easy way to try establish yourself as the only &#8216;real and dependable&#8217; news station wouldn&#8217;t you say?)
