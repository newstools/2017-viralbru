The South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights wants inmates to be allowed cellphones in jail to warn of imminent attacks and violence.Now this does immediately pose problems.Prisoner&#8217;s will easily be able to plan and co-ordinate with associates on the outside, thus allowing for the planning of further crimes, and also possibly for outside help in a jailbreak.On the flip side, if these phones were bugged you could easily gather information on prisoners and it could actually allow for easier control and ability to monitor prison inmates.SAPOHR president Golden Miles Bhudu has said We are saying these are the gadgets that can still prevent the unnecessary deaths of prisoners and the unnecessary, illegal things happening in this institution. What do you think?
