So the Western Cape Health Department has barred emergency responders from entering &#8220;Red&#8221; zones without a police escort.Now you might be thinking that that&#8217;s terrible because people in these areas won&#8217;t be able to get access to emergency medical attention as soon as they would otherwise. What you have to keep in mind here, is that the safety of the paramedics is also of concern.There have been many instances where crews have been held-up at gunpoint, mugged, etc. It&#8217;s really putting a dampener on their enthusiasm for saving the lives of people who are going to knife them in the ribs for the ambulance.An EMS crew was held at gunpoint in the early hours of Tuesday morning while responding to an emergency call in J-Section, Khayelitsha.In a seperate incident an EMS crew was robbed while attending to a patient in Khayelitsha.You see why they might be losing the urge to come in and help?
