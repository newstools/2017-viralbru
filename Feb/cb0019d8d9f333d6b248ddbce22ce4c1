Mzukusi, a 30 year old taxi driver, survived a hail of bullets when he did his first trip as a taxi driver for Durban Liner Taxi Association.Mzukusi said he and his conductor, Mthandeni, were at the taxi rank at around 4pm when a taxi jammed them in and several people got out of the taxi. Suddenly, there was a gun at my head. I managed to push it away and started running. They started shooting. I don t know how the bullets missed me. I m going back to the Eastern Cape. I will never work in the taxi industry again, he said.A few hours later another driver was shot near Mega City.
