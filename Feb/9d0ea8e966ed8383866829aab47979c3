The recent flooding in the Sabie, didn&#8217;t only cause complications for vehicles. Animals struggled with the rapidly running rivers too.Some elephants got into trouble while they tried to cross the flooded river near Lower Sabie three weeks ago. First I thought they were swimming but soon realised the current was sweeping them away, wrote Marijke Arends-Meiring It was nerve wrecking. I tried to keep up but with all the bushes it was not an easy task.Luckily all ended well and the elephants arrived safely.
