Jon Lewis Alexander, 54, is a store clerk who has served four tours of duty in Iraq during his 30 years in the U.S. military.Video surveillance from Saturday night captures the moment a would-be thief entered the Marionville, Mo., store where Alexander works. The thief hesitates for a moment and pulls a gun but not fast enough to dissuade Alexander from pulling his own Walther PPX 9 mm handgun and sticking it in the hapless thief&#8217;s mouth.
