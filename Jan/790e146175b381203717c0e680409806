So if you didn&#8217;t know, Brian Molefe, the ex-Eskom CEO could possibly be being sworn into Parliament after the 9th of February.Natasha Mazzone, the DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, says that Molefe who was found to be at the centre of State Capture in the &#8220;State of Capture&#8221; report of Thuli Madonsela, is not fit to hold office. As an incoming MP, Molefe would have to swear loyalty to the Constitution and put the people of South Africa first, not Zuma or his administration. Looks like Molefe is being rewarded by the ANC for being such a good dog. Good boy Molefe! Want a treat?Molefe was found to have had 58 telephone interactions with the Gupta&#8217;s in late 2015 and early 2016. Furthermore, his GPS records also place in the Saxonwold area (home to the Gupta&#8217;s) on many occasions. Likely at the infamous Saxonwold Shebeen, the mentioning of which caused him to break down and cry in a press conference. Parliament cannot be a dumping ground nor a thank-you playground for the failed and caught out, but loyal Zuma yes men, Mazzone said.&nbsp;
