Hooray! More scum! It&#8217;s funny how we&#8217;re constantly flooded with videos of robberies and hijackings in broad daylight, because we live in a society where criminals have no fear of being caught because of our lax law enforcement.How do we get the change we need? Petitions? Protests? The only thing for certain is that something needs to change.See below for the video of a man who gets his head slammed into his car, then threatened and surrounded by four men who proceed to rob him.
