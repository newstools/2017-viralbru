These are the consequences of a man offering to help a pregnant woman get to the clinic. Since the majority of social media users decided that the woman was sitting in the back because the farmer was racist and wouldn&#8217;t let her sit in the front has resulted in a serious change of heart from farmers.The majority have simply said, and I&#8217;m paraphrasing here, that it&#8217;s more trouble than it&#8217;s worth to offer a lift. The backlash from people who don&#8217;t understand the situation and still feel the need to involve themselves.Good on you Social Justice Warriors for making people even less friendly to each other.
