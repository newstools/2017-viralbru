A video form Facebook user, Jaco Van Den Heever shows a taxi drifting from one lane to the other while Jaco speculates as to whether the driver is drunk or not.Eventually the taxi drifts over on to the wrong side of the road and collides with a woman. Jaco gets out to see if she&#8217;s okay and luckily she is. It&#8217;s just her car that&#8217;s busted up.The video is captioned &#8220;And then SAPS let rhe driver go.&#8221; so we assume that the taxi driver was let off scot free.
