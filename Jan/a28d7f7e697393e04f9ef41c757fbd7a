This is yet another photo that someone is trying to use to cause racial divide in South Africa. This is what they posted on Facebook. Buntu Ntshinga to EFF Members VS ANC Members(South Africans Only) Another incident a woman put in a cage its&#8217; all thanx to the DAEFF coalition you deserve a round of applause for helping the DA to bring back the apartheid to South Africa again..Eblockwatch tracked down the owner. Here is the story: I have the story behind the picture. The owner of the bakkie stopped at the road works and a lady asked for a lift. She jumped on the back and climbed into the cage. The owner asked her if she wanted to sit in front and she said no. He then dropped her off in town. She waved thank you to him and he drove off. He says that he often gives lifts to people because he feels sorry for them and he feels that he is building goodwill in South Africa by assisting where he can.eblockwatch
