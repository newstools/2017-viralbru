Since when is Racism considered art? Excellent question. There&#8217;s a serious problem in our society currently, and the label of the Rainbow Nation is a lie we keep telling ourselves. South Africans like to pretend we&#8217;re the rainbow nation but contradict ourselves when we systemically destroy any chance at being that.I&#8217;m not saying the dislike for white people is totally undeserved. However, the consistent aggravation between people based on race is a cancer that holds South Africa back.Dean Hutton&#8217;s F*ck White People art exhibit is one such cancer. Not only that, but it&#8217;s a complete publicity stunt by a self loathing person and an attention seeker.Check out Renaldo Gouws&#8217; perspective:Please support this SA YouTuber for his awesome content and telling it like it is.
