On Saturday, children were riding one of those swing/carousel rides at the Cresta Shopping Centre when suddenly the top of the carousel flipped over and down into the enclosed space with the children.Surpisingly and luckily nobody was hurt in this situation. Well according to the shopping center management at least/Four girls have complained of headaches and blue mark son their legs and stiff neck. The parents say they&#8217;ll be taking the children to family doctors, especially after the order of events at Health-Worx in the basement of the Cresta Shopping Centre which they were recommended to.Upon arrival at the medical centre, parents were given forms to fill out. It took so long, they didn t assist the girls first, they wanted us to fill in new client forms first, said Nicolene Jonker (mother).The children remained unattended for 45 minutes because the parents were busy with paperwork. Health-Worx said we have to do the paperwork due to Cresta management not paying their medical incident bill with them. A doctor arrived. She attended to each child for about 20 seconds, checking for concussions, and then sending them off, said Jonker.&nbsp;
