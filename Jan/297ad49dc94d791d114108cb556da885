Gareth Cliff posted a meme on Instagram making fun of the women&#8217;s Anti-Trump March that took place across the world on Saturday.Firstly people, this is how democracy works (in it&#8217;s simplest form):Trump is president of the USA.Deal.With.It.Your candidate didn&#8217;t win. Having a tantrum won&#8217;t change that. I blame the 21st century mindset of expecting people to care that you&#8217;re offended and upset.This is Gareth Cliff&#8217;s Instagram post:Cliff was accused of being sexist by many women online. (Personally I think this is more general fat-shaming than sexism but whatever.)Here are some of the comments:&#8220;This is disrespectful and sexist and one of the reasons so many women marched. Sexist jokes are never funny, I thought you were smarter than that.&#8221;&#8220;There are plenty of things in the world to laugh about, sexism isn&#8217;t one of them&#8221;&#8220;Talk about body shaming. I didn&#8217;t find this funny at all. Calling people out on their appearance is not humorous at all.&#8221;&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost all my respect for you!&#8221;&#8220;This isn&#8217;t funny, it completely discredits such an inspirational movement.&#8221;Make of this what you will.
