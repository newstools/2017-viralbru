One of the things i enjoy about Renaldo Gouws&#8217; videos is that, regardless of topic, everything is handled so objectively and what he has to say is engaging and thought provoking.The fact that the BLM (Black Lives Matter) and FMF (Fees Must Fall) protests grew from safe spaces does not diminish what the movements aim to achieve.(and to be clear I&#8217;m not saying that this is Gouws&#8217; message.) &nbsp;But it does explain the behaviour of these protesters to a certain extent.
