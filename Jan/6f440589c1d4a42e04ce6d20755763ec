The ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal has been threatening to shut down Absa bank branches every month-end until the bank &#8220;pays back what it owes.&#8221;About 500 ANCYL members picketed outside the Absa branch in the Durban CBD. There were also pickets in Kokstad in the Harry Gwala region, but from next month there will be pickets outside every Absa branch in the province until the shareholder pays back the money, said KZN provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabela.It has been reported that Absa could be forced to pay R2.25 billion to the fiscus for an unlawful apartheid-era bank bailout. The money is part of the so-called Lifeboat loans that was loaned to the Bancorp group bank that was acquired by Absa in around 1995. That money could be used for the development in the country and it could be used to fund free education, said Sabelo.(Or another fire pool at Nkandla)
