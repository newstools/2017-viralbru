Malema made a jab at Mugabe whilst speaking to the media at the EFF&#8217;s Braamfontein headquarters on Monday. He said that he respects what Mugabe has done, but staying in power is not beneficial for the struggle. &#8220;Grandpa, it&#8217;s enough now&#8221; Malema says at the end.The Zimbabwean government didn&#8217;t take too kindly to this calling Malema a Gucci revolutionary who has betrayed the ruling ANC .
