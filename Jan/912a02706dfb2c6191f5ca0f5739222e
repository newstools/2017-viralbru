Another clip has emerged of bullying in SA schools. This one involves two learners from Ho rskool Schoonspruit. With the uproar this is causing on social media, the school principal Dries de Beer, has tried to insist that it isn&#8217;t bullying. I have seen the video and it wasn t a case of bullying just two boys getting into a scuffle after school hours off the school premises, de Beer said. We are a model school when it comes to curbing bullying and I would happily open my doors to anyone who wants to discuss the issue. Kids will be kids, we had no control over this incident. Yes, model indeed.
