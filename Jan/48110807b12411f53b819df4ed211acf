Newborn babies are being traded on a lucrative black market in Malaysia, possibly involving hundreds of children a year, going illegally to parents offshore.The country introduced strict laws in 1983 to stop adoption agencies operating as so-called baby farms for foreign customers but according to the Commission for Child Protection, it has driven the practice underground.Police arrested a syndicate of six women accused of buying babies, arranging identity documents and selling them at a huge mark-up in West Jakarta
