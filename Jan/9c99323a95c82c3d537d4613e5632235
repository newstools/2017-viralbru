&#8220;TRUMP?! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN??&#8221;It happened because you banned super-size sodas. And smoking in parks. And offensive ideas on campus. Because you branded people who oppose gay marriage &#8216;homophobic&#8217;, and people unsure about immigration &#8216;racist&#8217;. Because you treated owning a gun and never having eaten quinoa as signifiers of fascism. Because you thought correcting people&#8217;s attitudes was more important than finding them jobs. Because you turned &#8216;white man&#8217; from a description into an insult. Because you used slurs like &#8216;denier&#8217; and &#8216;dangerous&#8217; against anyone who doesn&#8217;t share your eco-pieties. Because you treated dissent as hate speech and criticism of Obama as extremism. Because you talked more about gender-neutral toilets than about home repossessions. Because you beatified Caitlyn Jenner. Because you policed people&#8217;s language, rubbished their parenting skills, took the piss out of their beliefs. Because you cried when someone mocked the Koran but laughed when they mocked the Bible. Because you said criticising Islam is Islamophobia. Because you kept telling people, &#8220;You can&#8217;t think that, you can&#8217;t say that, you can&#8217;t do that&#8221;. Because you turned politics from something done by and for people to something done to them, for their own good. Because you treated people like dirt. And people don&#8217;t like being treated like dirt. Trump happened because of you.
