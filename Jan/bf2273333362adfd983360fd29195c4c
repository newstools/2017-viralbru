According to a report in the Sunday Times, The African Independent Congress (AIC) may withdraw from the coalition which ensures that the ANC controls Ekurhuleni in Gauteng and Rustenberg in North West.Apparently the AIC were misled by the ANC who told them they would consider their proposal of incorporating Matatile into KwaZulu-Natal.The president of AIC Mandla Galo said on Friday that his congress had give n power to the ANC after the ANC had allegedly begged them.Since then the ANC have repeatedly avoided meetings to discuss the demands of the AIC.For the ANC to meet the AIC s demand, it would require the government to redraw the boundaries between KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.The ANC has lost control of Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay metros, and it seems that more is to come!Stay tuned for the crash and burn of the party that is crippling SA!
