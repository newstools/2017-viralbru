Andrew Hall has posted a crazy story on Facebook, stating that his E-Cigarette exploded in his mouth.Hall does admit that this sounds like a fake news story and says I would have said no way that s possible until now. He&#8217;s lost seven teeth and has serious burns on his face and neck.Nobody knows the cause of the explosion. Freak accident or lack of maintenance?E-Cigarette companies have not yet commented.
