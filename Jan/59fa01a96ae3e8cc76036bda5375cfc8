St Peter&#8217;s College is an independent, co-educational Anglican private secondary school located in Johannesburg, South Africa.St Peter&#8217;s College is also the location where taxi&#8217;s have been witnessed casually driving on the wrong side of the road.Now we know this happens countrywide. I experienced it this morning actually.This is just the latest footage. Isn&#8217;t it interesting that taxi&#8217;s are continually allowed to do whatever they want. Where&#8217;s Metro Police at?
