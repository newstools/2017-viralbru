Large male lion in high grass and warm evening light &#8211; Masai Mara, KenyaThree lions were killed for their body parts at a Turffontein farm near the Ranch conservancy and resort outside Polokwane.&#8220;Two of the lions, both males, had their heads and paws cut off. The third one, a female, was not cut,&#8221; said police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo.&#8220;The police are looking for suspects responsible for the killing of the lions [on charges of] unlawful hunting or hunting of specially protected animals without a permit,&#8221; said MojapeloLions are targeted by poachers for their body parts which are used in traditional medicine.&nbsp;Opinion: You know what needs to happen? Traditional medicine needs to stop being called traditional medicine. It&#8217;s not medicine. It doesn&#8217;t work. I don;t care if it&#8217;s disrespectful of certain cultures, surely keeping a species of animal on this planet is more important than you using a lion&#8217;s paw as Viagra.
