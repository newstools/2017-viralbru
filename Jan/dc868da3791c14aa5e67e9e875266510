To those calling Kyle Abbot a &#8220;user&#8221; or &#8220;traitor&#8221;&#8230; If you remember correctly, an in form and on fire Kyle Abbott was left out of the 2015 World Cup semifinal on the instruction of administrators who wanted Vernon Philander to fulfill the race quota for the team&#8230; which cost us a possible World Cup victory. So when it was his moment to shine and represent his country, Cricket South Africa took it away from him and took it away from us. CSA has made it clear that a maximum of five white players can appear in a team&#8230; with those odds I don&#8217;t blame anyone taking an opportunity overseas when it arises. As long as politics are involved in sport this will happen, and I can&#8217;t fault players for stacking the odds in their favour.Good luck overseas Kyle, and thanks for being such a gentleman on and off the field! Go and make the best of it bud, a true cricket lover will support you no matter what!Renaldo Gouws
